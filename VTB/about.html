At its heart, the travel bureau is a notice board where you can find new destinations to discover. Each flyer or brochure represents another unfiction experience waiting for you. Whether you're seeking alternate reality games, interactive narratives, or immersive fiction - the stories you discover here will be fascinating adventures.
        <br><br>
The travel bureau is another way to find new games to play, new puzzles to solve, and new metafictional narrative to dive into. The site works best on a desktop or laptop. In Chrome, right click a document to visit its related resources. Special thanks to Beeptest for use of the document interface.
