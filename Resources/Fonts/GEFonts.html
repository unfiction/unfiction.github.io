<font size="2">Created by <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@buildingthemagic" target="_blank">Building the Magic</a></i></font><br><br>
This collection of fan-made fonts is designed to help you create new and interesting objects, props, and art based in the world created by Walt Disney Imagineering and Lucas Films at <i>Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge</i> in Disneyland Park and Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World.
<br>
<br>
These fonts were traced from photographs and scans of documents from a variety of different sources. Each of these fonts was created from scratch - they are recreations of fonts used in the Disney Parks, not official releases in any way.

<h2>The Typefaces</h2>
<ul>

<li><blockquote><div class="batuubeshfoo">Clean up after your creature or droid.</div></blockquote><b><div class="batuubesh">BatuuBesh</div></b><br>
BatuuBesh is a typeface based on the handwritten Aurebesh that guests find scattered around the Black Spire Outpost. The glyphs are based on those that appeared in <i>Star Wars: the Visual Encyclopedia</i> (2017). "Ligatures" uses the combined characters of the Legends continuity; "Canon" omits these automated replacements.<br><br>Download: <a href="OTFs/BatuuBesh (Canon).otf">BatuuBesh (Canon).otf</a> or <a href="OTFs/BatuuBesh (Ligatures).otf">BatuuBesh (Ligatures).otf</a><br><br>
</li>
<br/><br/>

<li><blockquote><div class="batuuchalkboardfoo">Batuuan Beef and Crispy Topato Stir-fry with a  Moof Juice</div></blockquote><div class="batuuchalkboard">Batuu Chalkboard</div><br>
This typeface is based on the chalkboard-style fonts used for the menu boards in Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo. The glyphs have a distinct hand-drawn feel, reflecting Strono "Cookie" Tuggs' one-week-a-month itinerant tenancy of in Black Spire Outpost.<br><br>Download: <a href="OTFs/BatuuChalkboard.otf">BatuuChalkboard.otf</a><br><br>

</li>
<br/><br/>

<li><blockquote><div class="batuusignpainterfoo">At this time, all boarding groups have been distributed for today.</div></blockquote><div class="batuusignpainter">Batuu Signpainter</div><br>
This typeface is based on a handpainted script used to alert guests that Rise of the Resistance's boarding groups had been fully distributed for the day. The letter shapes are very similar to Batuu Chalkboard and High Galactic Body, but offer streaks and brushstroke features.<br><br>Download:  <a href="OTFs/BatuuSignPainter.otf">BatuuSignPainter.otf</a><br><br>

</li>
<br/><br/>

<li><blockquote><div class="batuuprintshopfoo">Take the statue out of the dark and into the light where it belongs.</div></blockquote><div class="batuuprintshop">Batuu Printshop</div><br>
Based on signs and menu boards from throughout the Bazaar area of Black Spire Outpost, this typeface resembles nicked and worn hand typesetter’s blocks. As with the sign painter variation, the glyphs mimic other letter forms seen on Batuu but with an additional handmade texture.<br><br>Download:  <a href="OTFs/BatuuPrintshop.otf">BatuuPrintshop.otf</a><br><br>

</li>
<br/><br/>


<li><blockquote><div class="hgbodyfoo">Oga Garra's cantina adheres to a strict code of conduct that tries to keep its unruly patrons in check.</div></blockquote><b><div class="hgbody">High Galactic Body</div></b><br>
The basic typeface seen throughout Black Spire Outpost, this version of High Galactic appears as body text on many of the menus in the land, including Oga’s Cantina. The crisp, angular letterforms at once feel familiar and legible while telegraphing that guests are not on Earth any longer.<br><br>Download:  <a href="OTFs/BatuuanHighGalacticBody.otf">BatuuanHighGalacticBody.otf</a><br><br>

</li>
<br/><br/>

<li><blockquote><div class="hginfofoo">Join us on a mission to stop the First Order.</div></blockquote><div class="hginfo">High Galactic Info</div><br>
Much like its cousin above, High Galactic Info feels familiar but foreign at the same time. This typeface is seen primarily on safety warning signs at the entrance to both of Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge’s attractions: Smuggler’s Run and Rise of the Resistance.<br><br>Download:  <a href="OTFs/BatuuanHighGalacticInfo.otf">BatuuanHighGalacticInfo.otf</a><br><br>

<li><blockquote><div class="ohnakahandfoo">NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY
MISSIONS START IMMEDIATELY
INQUIRE WITHIN. @#$</div></blockquote><div class="ohnakahand">Ohnaka Hand</div><br>
With similar letterforms as its chalkboard cousin, this handwritten font appears on posters scattered throughout the queue of Millennium Falcon: Smuggler’s Run advertising Hondo Ohnaka’s offer of employment in his <s>smuggling</s> shipping operation. Includes three glyphs (@, #, $) to represent the hand-drawn version of the recruitment poster icons.<br><br>Download:  <a href="OTFs/Ohnaka Hand.otf">Ohnaka Hand.otf</a><br><br>

</li>
<br/><br/>

<li><blockquote><div class="lenkamokfoo">we'll need your help to take the coaxium tomorrow.</div></blockquote><b><div class="lenkamok">Lenka Mok's Hand</div></b><br>
Drawn from notes distributed to guests following the Resistance storyline aboard the Halcyon Starcruiser, this handwritten font is distinctive while being easily legible in show lighting. Being written by cruise director Lenka Mok means that the letter K has a particular flourish.<br><br>Download:  <a href="OTFs/LenkaMokPenReactive.otf">LenkaMokPenReactive.otf</a> or  <a href="OTFs/LenkaMokPenStatic.otf">LenkaMokPenStatic.otf</a><br><br>

</li>
<br/><br/>

<li><blockquote><div class="spireglyphsfoo">one of the oldest establishments on Black Spire Outpost</div></blockquote><b><div class="spireglyphs">SpireGlyphs</div></b><br>
SpireGlyphs is a typeface based on the ancient script in the cornice work of Dok Ondar's Den of Antiquities and below the build table in Savi's Workshop. The geometric designs are indescipherable, so they've been mapped here to characters that resemble their shape in High Galactic.<br><br>Download:  <a href="OTFs/SpireGlyphs.otf">SpireGlyphs.otf</a><br><br>
